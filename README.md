# Pimple Popper

### Overview
"Pimple Popper" is a game inspired by my personal relationship with acne. Most people can relate to having to deal with pimples, so I feel this is a good way to make light of a situation that can feel embarrassing.

### Gameplay
Click all the pimples on the face before the pimples **CONSUME** the face! Game utilizes p5.play [drawing depth and order](http://molleindustria.github.io/p5.play/examples/index.html?fileName=sprite7.js) and [collisions between groups and event functions](http://molleindustria.github.io/p5.play/examples/index.html?fileName=collisions2.js).

## Time-line
- Finish 3.0
- Finish 3.1
- Finish 3.2
- Add 3.3/screen switches
- Compile/complete all assets
- Add collisions2 from p5.play
- Tweak gameplay and functions to what I want it to do
- Link/fix screen switches/bugs (if needed)
- Make visually appealing
